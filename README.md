# This is a Pak-US lobby tracker

FARA = Foreign Agents Registration Act of the United States.

FARA is a US federal law passed in 1938.

It requires any person or organization acting in the United States on behalf of a foreign government, political party, or foreign entity to register with the Department of Justice (DOJ).

Registrants must file reports and submit documents—contracts, communications, political activities, payments, etc.

Those reports become part of a public database, which includes PDFs of filings.

Core idea: It doesn’t ban foreign lobbying. It only forces disclosure.

This disclosure can lead to understanding how different political stakeholders interact with each other.

Since this tracker focuses on Pakistan, it only pulls the documents where someone in the U.S. filed paperwork because they were working on behalf of the Pakistan government, entity, political actor, or busienss with foreign influence implications.
